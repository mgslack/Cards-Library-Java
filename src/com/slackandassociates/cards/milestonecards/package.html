 <title>Milestone Cards Package</title>
 <body>
  Package containing milestone card implementation and images.  Includes image
  'cache' class for preloading milestone card images for use in a graphical U/I.
  Milestone also known as 'Mille Bornes'.  There are 106 cards in a deck of
  Milestone cards.<br>
  For a game of milestone, hand sizes are 7 cards (unsorted).  On each each turn,
  a player will play into their or opponents speed / battle piles, in one of their
  4 safety spots or discard, then draw a card from the deck, if any left.  Game
  round continues till all cards are played or discarded.<br>
  Example code using Milestone card implementation:
  <pre>
  {@code
   // setup milestone card deck
   CardDeck cards = new CardDeck(MilestoneCardDeck.MC_DECK, MilestoneCard.class);
   cards.shuffle();
   ...
   // create hands (only 2 hands) - 7 cards, should be stored unsorted
   CardHand[] hands = new CardHand[2];
   for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) hands[i] = new CardHand(7, false);
   ...
   // deal out hands
   for (int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
       for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++) hands[j].add(cards.getNextCard());
   ...
   // play out game using methods from CardHand and CardDeck
   hands[i].removeAll();
   hands[i].remove(idx);
   hands[i].cardAt(idx);
   etc.
  }
  </pre>
